# DjangoSideProject
this is a side project working with django.
following this: http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754/ch05.html#_processing_a_post_request_on_the_server
to learn about test driven development, then changing to make an app.
stay tuned xd

i put this project on pause, trying to actually learn django first before going deep into this. will resume this project in ~1 month ETA.

in the mean time i created a new git repo for the real django tutorial
